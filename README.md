# PA1484 – Software Development:  Project Storm

Readme-files on GitHub are formatted using Markdown. You can find information about how to format using Markdown here:

Your README file should include the at least the following sections:


## Introduction

This part should give a general introduction to your project. Briefly describe your project:
- What the system does
- What problem it solves
- What technologies it uses (ESP32, touchscreen, SMHI API, PlatformIO)
- What the main functionality is

## Getting started

This section should guide a new developer through the steps of how to set up the project and install the dependencies they need to start developing.

It can include:

### Prerequisites
### Installation


## Building and running

This is where you explain how to make the project run.

Examples of things to describe:

- How to build/upload the program to the ESP32  
- What your startup procedure looks like  
- If the program accepts different arguments or modes  
- How to operate the program (e.g., touchscreen interaction)


## Features

Lastly, write which of the user stories you did and didn't develop in this project,  in the form of a checklist. Like this:

- [x] US1.1C:  As a user, I want to see a starting screen to display the current program
      version and group number on the first screen
- [x] US1.3: As a user, I want to have a screen to view weather forecast data.
- [x] US1.2C: As a user, I want to see the weather forecast for the next 7 days for the
      selected city on the second screen in terms of temperature and weather conditions
      with symbols (e.g., clear sky, rain, snow, thunder) per day at 12:00.
- [x] US2.1: As a user, I want to be able to navigate between different screens (like forecast
      screen) by sliding a finger over the touch screen.
- [x] US3.1: As a user, I want to have a screen to view historical weather data.
- [x] US3.2D: As a user, on the third screen I want to view the latest months (SMHI API
      period: latest-months) of historical hourly data for selected weather parameter in the
      selected city, using a slider to interact with the historical graph by scrolling where a
      depleted slider corresponds to the oldest datapoint and a full slider corresponds to the
      latest datapoint.
- [x] US4.1: As a user, on the fourth screen, I want to access a single settings screen to
      configure both the city and weather parameter options.
- [x] US4.2B: As a user, I want to select from four weather parameters, namely
      temperature (1), humidity (6), wind speed (4), and Air pressure (9), using a dropdown
      list, to customize the historical graph.
- [x] US4.3B: As a user, I want to select from five different cities, namely
      Karlskrona(65090), Stockholm(97400), Göteborg(72420), Malmö(53300), and
      Kiruna(180940), using a dropdown, to view their weather data for the historical data
      and starting screen forecast.
- [x] US4.4: As a user, I want to reset the selected city and weather parameter to default
      using a button.
- [x] US4.5: As a user, I want to set my default city and weather parameter to the current
      selection using a button, so they are automatically selected when I start the device.
- [x] US4.6: As a user, I want the device to store my default city and weather parameter so
      that they are retained even after a restart.
